# OFDM Transceiver using MATLAB

- Simulated OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) transmitter and receiver with BPSK as the modulation technique.
- Obtained BER vs SNR with different 
  - sub-carriers
  - cyclic prefix
  - channel length
  - number of blocks 
- SNR has been increased from 5 dB to 55 dB with a 5 dB step size. 

This is mostly a learning exercise for me, for practicing writing and verifying RTL code
